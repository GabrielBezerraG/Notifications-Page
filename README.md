# Notifications Page
This is a solution to the [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My Process
The page was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My approach was to create a JavaScript object with all the data supplied and build each notification dynamically. When an unread notification is clicked, not only the style is modified, but also the object is updated and the notifications are re-rendered, along with the counter.
